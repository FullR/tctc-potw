The short, fun, challenging word problems in this 48-page book focus on key critical thinking skills and reading comprehension. Students read a short passage&mdash;less than half a page&mdash;and analyze a picture. Next they answer challenging questions about what can be inferred or deduced from information in the passage.
<br/>
<br/>
The depth of analysis required to answer the questions correctly produces superb reading comprehension skills and teaches students how to find and evaluate evidence. These puzzles can be solved independently or used for educational fun at home or in a classroom. Try one if you dare!
