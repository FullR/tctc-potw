Students attack each puzzle by focusing row by row. As they analyze the objects in the row, they use the clues for that row to identify what objects could be in the solution. After they identify what objects could be in the solution in that row, they synthesize that information with objects that could be in the solution in the other rows. Finally, they take the synthesized clues and try different possible combinations until they identify the solution.
