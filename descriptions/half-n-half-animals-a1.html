<em>Half 'n Half Animals</em> present students with the challenge of completing a picture that is only half drawn. To complete the drawing, students must mentally flip the image to add the missing parts. Once the drawing is finished, students are encouraged to be creative by coloring the animal in imaginative ways and adding a setting and/or objects to their picture.
