The activities spiral slowly, allowing students to become comfortable with concepts, but also challenging them to continue building their problem-solving skills.  This book teaches more than mathematical concepts; it teaches mathematical reasoning, so students learn to devise different strategies to solve problems.  It is written to the standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.
