This engaging 376-page book develops critical thinking skills necessary for success in reading, writing, math, science, social studies, and standardized tests in Grades 2-3. The <em>Building Thinking Skills&reg;</em> series is the bestselling thinking skills program in the world! The engaging, highly-effective activities are developmentally sequenced. Each skill (for example, classifying) is presented first in the semi-concrete figural-spatial form and then in the abstract verbal form.

<br />
  <br />
     - Observing, recognizing, and describing characteristics <br />
     - Distinguishing similarities and differences <br />
     - Identifying and completing sequences, classifications, and analogies
<br />
  <br />
These processes help students develop superior thinking and communication skills that lead to deeper content learning in all subjects.
