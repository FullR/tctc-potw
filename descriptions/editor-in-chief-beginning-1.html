This fun, highly-effective 96-page book teaches students in Grades 2-3 grammar, punctuation, spelling, capitalization, and critical reading in a standards-based thinking approach instead of the usual drill and practice found in competing products. Students begin with an easy-to-understand lesson followed by an activity that requires students to carefully analyze and edit stories, letters, or articles that contain mechanical errors. This effective method allows students to gain mastery over concepts that will translate into their own writing.
