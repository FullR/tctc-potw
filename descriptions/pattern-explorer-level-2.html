Mathematics and science can be thought of as a search for patterns and structure. This 96-page book provides rich and diverse collections of pattern problems for students to explore, investigate, discover, and create. The five different types of pattern problems found in this book are:
<br />
  <br />
    - Pattern Predictor<br />
    - Equality Explorer<br />
    - Sequence Sleuth<br />
    - Number Ninja<br />
    - Function Finder
<br />
  <br />
There are optional hints and detailed solutions.

From a developmental perspective, the ability to recognize a pattern signals the transition from concrete to abstract thinking. So having students explore pattern problems helps sensitize them to the discovery process that provides a foundation for authentic learning and abstraction. These activities are independent and self-contained, but tend to build on one another and get gradually more sophisticated. This collection deliberately avoids use of variables, but involves reasoning that lays a genuine foundation for algebraic thinking and technique. Calculators are never needed, and their use is discouraged.
