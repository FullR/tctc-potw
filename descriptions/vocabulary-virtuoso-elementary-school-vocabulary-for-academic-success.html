Students complete a variety of exercises requiring critical reading and writing skills to contextualize the words. The exercises use other forms of the words as different parts of speech, so that students learn to recognize these forms as variations of the original words—further expanding their vocabulary and enabling them to use the words in more contexts. This book emphasizes the correct spelling of the vocabulary words with a Jumble activity that ask students to unscramble the word before writing the correct spelling to match the definition.
